<h1>Wu-Tang Clan</h1>
<p>The Wu-Tang Clan /ˈwuːtæŋklæn/ is an American hip hop group from Staten Island, New York City, originally composed of East Coast rappers RZA, GZA, Ol' Dirty Bastard, Method Man, Raekwon, Ghostface Killah, Inspectah Deck, U-God and Masta Killa. Cappadonna later became an official member of the group. The Wu-Tang Clan has released four gold and platinum studio albums. Its 1993 debut album, Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers), is considered to be one of the greatest albums in hip-hop history.[1][2][3]
The Wu-Tang Clan has introduced and launched the careers of a number of affiliated artists and groups, often collectively known as the Wu-Tang Killa Bees,[4] and has been described as one of the most influential hip-hop groups of all-time. In 2008, About ranked them "the No. 1 greatest hip hop group of all time".[5] Kris Ex of Rolling Stone called Wu-Tang Clan "the best rap group ever".[6] In 2004, NME hailed them as one of the most influential groups of the last ten years.[7]</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Foundation and Name</h3>
<p>All in Together Now was never signed to a record label. See, me, GZA, and ODB had a crew called FOI: Force of the Imperial Master, nah mean? We made a song, called "All in Together Now", which became famous on tapes throughout Brooklyn, Downtown Staten Island, New York, all the way down to Miami. I remember Biz Markie, when he was famous and I wasn't famous, and he was like: "Yo! I heard that shit! Your song with Ason Unique and The Specialist." I was the Scientist. So we never got signed as a group back then. We never had a serious record deal under that title.[8]

-RZA
The Wu-Tang Clan was assembled in the early 1990s with RZA as the de facto leader and the group's producer.[4] Method Man – who met RZA in 1990 after hearing a tape the producer recorded as Prince Rakeem – recalled:

I went round his house. We went to the basement and I guess they was showin' off 'cos I was there. There'd be RZA and his brother Devon on the decks. RZA was cuttin', Devon'd go cut off the light, then RZA's go cut on the light, Devon'd be cutting, then he'd go cut off the light. They was doing some wild shit, man. And Ol' Dirty was there and he'd echo every rhyme of RZA's while beatboxing, 'cos that was in style then. That was the beginning of Wu-Tang.[9]

RZA and Ol' Dirty Bastard adopted the name for the group after the film Shaolin and Wu Tang.[10] The group's debut album loosely adopted a Shaolin vs. Wu-Tang theme, dividing the album into Shaolin and Wu-Tang sections.[11]

The group developed backronyms for the name (as hip hop pioneers such as KRS-One and Big Daddy Kane did with their names), including "We Usually Take All Niggas' Garments", "Witty Unpredictable Talent And Natural Game", and "Wisdom of the Universe, and the Truth of Allah for the Nation of the Gods".[10]</p>

<h2>Members</h2>

<h4>RZA (born Robert Fitzgerald Diggs, 1969)</h4> 

<p> - The de facto leader of the group. He produced the entirety of Enter the Wu-Tang and the majority of the tracks on subsequent Wu-Tang albums. He has also produced many of the group's solo efforts, especially early on. Considered a producing pioneer, his popularity has transcended hip-hop. Thanks to Jim Jarmusch giving him his break with Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai, he has gone on to score several Hollywood films such as the first installment of Quentin Tarantino's critically acclaimed Kill Bill, Tony Jaa's The Protector and Ridley Scott's American Gangster. Most recently he scored the music for the anime series Afro Samurai. Before signing with SRC Records in early 2007, RZA was flooded with offers from Bad Boy Records, Aftermath Entertainment, Interscope and Def Jam among others.[78] In 2012, RZA directed, co-wrote, and had a lead acting role in The Man with the Iron Fists.</p>

<h4>GZA</h4> 

<p>(born Gary Grice, 1966) – He is the oldest member of the group as well as the most experienced, having begun rapping in 1976, when hip hop was still a local New York phenomenon.[79] He was also the first to release an album, Words from the Genius, which was released in 1991 on Cold Chillin'/Reprise. The interplay between and other members on the group's recordings shows him as the wisest MC of the group. He is known for his laid-back flow, deliberate style, and complex use of metaphor, containing references to Samurai films, chess and 5 Percenter teachings. Liquid Swords, his Wu-Tang debut album, is often considered among the group's best work, perhaps only challenged by Raekwon's Only Built 4 Cuban Linx....</p>

<h4>Ol' Dirty Bastard</h4>

<p>(born Russell Tyrone Jones, 1968–2004) – Arguably the most eccentric and erratic member of the group, his wild behavior drew significant media – and often police – attention. He was known for his off beat rhymes, charismatic ululations, slightly garbled style, and unpredictable vocal inflections. ODB was among the most popular members of Wu-Tang, with high sales and guest spots with industry giants like Mariah Carey. He collapsed in Wu-Tang's recording studio on November 13, 2004 and was pronounced dead less than an hour later, with a later autopsy confirming a drug overdose to be the cause of his death. The overdose was ruled accidental.[80]</p>

<h4>Method Man (born Clifford Smith, 1971)</h4>

 He was the youngest member of the Wu-Tang Clan and the first to release a Wu-Tang solo album with Tical, his career went on to become the most successful in the group, while maintaining an underground rep. His career is highlighted by platinum sales and a Grammy for I'll Be There for You/You're All I Need to Get By with Mary J. Blige. He is recognized by his distinct voice and smooth, yet "grimy" flow. He has also had a significant acting career with many film and television credits to his name, most notably the popular series, The Wire, where he portrayed the character of Cheese Wagstaff, the lieutenant of drug lord Proposition Joe. He also acted in the comedy film How High and the sitcom Method & Red, both co-starring with Redman, with whom he also made an album in 1999 titled Blackout! as well as the 2009 sequel Blackout! 2. Method Man's friendship with The Notorious B.I.G. is credited for preventing more heat between Biggie, Raekwon and Ghostface.[81]


<h4>Raekwon (born Corey Woods, 1970)</h4>

<p>Nicknamed "The Chef" for having "lyrical flavor", and ability to cook cocaine into "crack rock." His lyrics contain extensive use of New York slang (and some of which he invented), which is often delivered in an aggressive, fast-paced manner. He is also known for his vivid storytelling about wealth, power, and prestige derived from the illegal drug trade. His influential solo album Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... is often credited with initiating the Mafioso rap phenomenon of the mid-to-late-1990s, and is generally considered one of the best of the solo albums by both fans and critics. The sequel to the influential album was released in late 2009 titled Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... Pt. II.
Ghostface Killah (born Dennis Coles, 1970) – He has a very distinctive, abstract, energetic and emotional style of rapping and is arguably the most consistent member of the group. He had a large role in Raekwon's Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... and later released his debut album Ironman to critical acclaim. Mainstream hip-hop press credits his second album Supreme Clientele with "saving the Wu." He has enjoyed similar success over the course of 12 solo albums, more than any other member of the group.</p>


<h4>Inspectah Deck (born Jason Hunter, 1970)</h4>

<p>He was one of the star members of the group, gaining attention by providing stand-out performances on both Wu-Tang albums and on other member's solo albums as well as being a popular guest rapper in 1997 and 1998. He is considered by many in the fanbase as the stand-out member on Wu-Tang Forever, although his later solo albums failed to live up to the high expectations. Inspectah Deck is known for his ability to use metaphors and deliver complicated rhyme-schemes. He is also a successful producer, providing beats for many artists both in and out of the Wu-Tang family such as Ghostface Killah, Method Man, Big Pun, Prodigy, and others.
U-God (born Lamont Jody Hawkins, 1970) – A founding member with his own solo career, U-God's has had a relatively low profile, in part due to his limited exposure, from being incarcerated for most of the recording of 36 Chambers, in which he only delivered short verses on "Da Mystery of Chessboxin'" and "Protect Ya Neck." He is known for delivering strong verses, his unique "bass-like" voice, and his style of blaxploitation rap.
Masta Killa (born Elgin Turner, 1969) – He was the only member not already an experienced rapper at the time of the group's formation, and was extensively mentored by GZA during his early days with the group. He was largely absent on the group's first album due to his being incarcerated, though he did contribute the classic final verse to the track "Da Mystery of Chessboxin", He also had stand-out verses to Wu-Tang Forever and other members solo albums, delivered with an intelligent talk-rap style. Fans have praised his work on classic Wu tracks like "Duel of the Iron Mic", "Snakes" or "Winter Warz" among others. He was also the last to release a solo album, though when he finally did release No Said Date, it was generally well received and considered one of the best post-2000 Wu-Tang releases.[82]</p>


<h4>Cappadonna (born Darryl Hill, 1969)</h4>

<p>After growing up as friends with many of the Clan members, Cappadonna made his debut as an affiliate of the Wu-Tang Clan on Raekwon's hit single "Ice Cream". He was also a guest star, along with Raekwon, on Ghostface Killah's solo debut album, Ironman. He made his first appearance on a Wu-Tang Clan album in 1997 on Wu-Tang Forever on the single "Triumph". Following his appearance on Forever, he contributed significantly to the group's third studio album, The W, at which point his appearances were no longer marked with "Feat. Cappadonna", as they had been on Forever. After a falling out with RZA the next year over royalties, he did not appear at all on the group's subsequent album Iron Flag. He eventually reunited with the group for their concert at 2004's Rock the Bells, and appeared on 2007's 8 Diagrams.
Cappadonna's status as an official member was at one point unclear. While long referred to by both the group and fans as the "unofficial tenth member", there was no confirmation on whether he actually became the official tenth member following the death of Ol' Dirty Bastard. MTV.com's biographies of both him and the group claim that he is an official member.[83] However, while his vocals on 8 Diagrams were not marked with "Feat. Cappadonna", much like his contributions to the group's The W album, he does not appear on the front cover with the original eight living members, and is not featured in the album's booklet with a picture, although he is included in the group's shout-out's sections. A 2007 interview about the Clan before the release of 8 Diagrams also claims that RZA officially added him as a member, but there were no quotations or statements to back up this claim within the article.[84] He would also appear credited as a member on the 2012 Wu-Tang Clan song "Six Directions of Boxing" off the soundtrack for RZA's The Man with the Iron Fists and be confirmed to be working on the group's sixth studio album. Cappadonna would be one of the most significant workers on the sixth album A Better Tomorrow.[85] More recently, multiple publications such as NME,[86] XXL,[87] HipHopDX,[88] and MTV[89] have referred to Cappadonna as an official member of the group. In 2014, RZA definitively clarified Cappadonna's status as an official member stating that Cappadonna had been an official member of the group since the group's 8 Diagrams album.[32]</p>
